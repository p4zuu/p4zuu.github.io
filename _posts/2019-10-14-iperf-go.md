## iperf3

Nothing better than iperf's developper to explain what iperf3 is:

> iPerf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. 
> It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, buffers and protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP with IPv4 and IPv6).
> For each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other parameters. 
> This is a new implementation that shares no code with the original iPerf and also is not backwards compatible. 

I do not develop Iperf. For more information see the [ESNET page](https://software.es.net/iperf)

## Wrapping

iperf3 API is very powerfull, but it is in C, and I had to integrate it in a Golang service. Fortunatly, CGo enables C wrapping with Go, wonderful. 
The API is not fully wrapping yet, but the main functions are wrapped. This will allows you to open an iperf_test server and a client. I currently work for wrapping stream functions.


## Example

Just have a look on the [github repo](https://github.com/LthomasMP/iperf_go), there is an example. Feel free to change it on your own.
