## First steps in fuzzing

A few weeks ago, I was starting to get interested into fuzzing. I read many articles describing what fuzzing is, and 
when it is used. I found interest in libFuzzer, ASAN, and Go-Fuzz. The problem is, when you see people finding many
security issues with these tools, you immediately want to try them by yourself. So I tried some of them. I started with Go-Fuzz.

## Find the first target

To make my first steps, I needed to find a case study to fuzz, in a language that I know. Since several months, 
I write and read Go every day, and that's a language that I like, so why don't I choose a Go target.
To improve my chance of finding bugs, I needed to find a target that deals with raw data, and that does not expect bad
input. The classic target is a parser. But there is a constraint, I have to find a target that has not been 
fuzzed by Google (with [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) for example), because if I do, I will not find 
anything, obviously. So let's try something like a JSON parser, like [jsonparser](https://github.com/buger/jsonparser). 
I used this parser when I was intern a few months ago, it worked very well, but does it deal fuzzing?

## Golang fuzzing

[go-fuzz](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz) from [Dmitry Vyukov](https://twitter.com/dvyukov?lang=fr) is awesome. 
Its use is very simple: you find a target function, you call it (with input generated by the fuzzing engine) 
into a `Fuzz` function, and that's it. You just need to prepare a corpus in which you create expected or unexpected 
inputs for your target function. I strongly advise you to read documentation and related articles on the go-fuzz Github page. 
Moreover, it can work with `libFuzzer`, what is very great.

## Fuzzing

### Identify the target

After reviewing the jsonparser's code, I identified several functions that could be vulnerable, one of them is the `GetInt` 
function. The function parses a JSON input as a `bytes slice` (perfect for `go-fuzz`) and identifies an integer in the JSON,
with a given key. Very easy to fuzz.

### Corpus

The corpus was a little bit tricky to understand for when I started fuzzing, but it is very simple. You create a 
directory in which you create files containing well-formed or malformed inputs. In my case, I created two files that 
will be used by the engine to build its fuzzing inputs and new corpus files.
I created the file `1`, containing:

```json
{"a":[{"b":1},{"d":2}],"c":1}
```

And a file `2` containing

```json
{"a":"toto", "b":2,"c":1}
```

### Running the fuzzer

Launching the fuzzer is very simple, just call your target function wrapped inside `Fuzz` function:

```golang
package fuzz

import (
    "github.com/buger/jsonparser"
)

func Fuzz(data []byte) int {
    jsonparser.GetInt(data, "a", "b")
    return 0
}
```

Once your corpus is fed:

```bash
$ go-fuzz-build
$ go-fuzz corpus/
```

### Results

After a few seconds of fuzzing, crashers start appearing:

```

This is clearly an infinite loop.

### Interpretation

Regarding these crashes, we can see that the two first ones are very similar. They are actually the same bug, but triggered
 twice. Crashers create an `ìndex out of range` in the `searchKeys` function, what is a kind of bug we were looking for. 
 Since this is Golang code, these bug could just lead to deny of service (by making the app using jsonparser crash), 
 but in C that would have been far more dangerous. The first bug could lead to an out-of-bound read or write, depending if the code tried to read or write in the array. 
 Let's report this bug with an issue. 
The third crash is different. The crasher triggers an infinite loop in the `BlockEnd` function. Again, that could lead to
a deny of service. Let's report this bug too.

## Conclusion

Finding these bugs was awesome, especially with fuzzing. This was the very first time I used fuzzing, and that's even cooler 
than I expected. Because, with fuzzing, you find crashes with a kind of magic. You don't even need to deeply understand 
the code you fuzz, which is time-saving but bad. I will try to spend time to understand the code that I fuzzed to spot 
were the bugs are, to pursue what I started.
