    <h1>About this site</h1>
    <p>This is the beginning of my blog. Posts will be better with time (I hope).</p>
    <p>I am junior software security engineer at Thales in France.</p>
    <p>I love looking deep into binaries, systems, and OS, understanding and finding vulnerabilities and their exploits. I also enjoy reverse engineering binaries, and software engineering in Go.</p>
    <p>You can contact me by <a href=mailto:{{site.email}}>mail</a> or find me on <a href={{site.linkedin}}>LinkedIn.</a></p>
